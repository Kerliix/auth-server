We are committed to fostering a respectful, safe, and inclusive environment for all Kerliix employees and authorized contributors.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Kerliix leadership, developers and project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project developer and maintainer at:

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Kerliix leadership is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
