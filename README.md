# Authentication & OAuth Server

This project is a Node.js-based authentication server that provides user **registration**, **login**, and **OAuth 2.0 provider** functionality. It allows clients to authenticate users via username/password and supports OAuth authorization flows to enable third-party applications to securely access user data.

---

## Features

- **User Registration:** Create new user accounts with secure password hashing.
- **User Login:** Authenticate existing users via local credentials.
- **OAuth 2.0 Provider:** Implements OAuth 2.0 flows (Authorization Code, Implicit, etc.) to authorize third-party applications.
- **JWT / Session Support:** Issue JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or manage sessions after authentication.
- **Password Security:** Passwords are hashed securely using bcrypt.
- **Token Revocation:** Support for token invalidation and refresh tokens.
- **Role-based Access Control:** (Optional) Support for user roles and permissions.
- **Extensible & Modular:** Easily extend with custom authentication strategies or OAuth scopes.

## Architecture Explanation
Client Application: This is any frontend or third-party application (web app, mobile app, or external service) that needs user authentication or wants to act as an OAuth client to access user data.

Authentication Server: The core Node.js server built with Express. It handles:

User Registration & Login: Receives and validates user credentials.

OAuth 2.0 Provider: Supports authorization flows using OAuth2orize or a custom implementation, allowing clients to request access tokens.

Token Management: Issues JWTs or session tokens for authenticated users.

Password Security: Hashes passwords securely using bcrypt before storing.

Database: Stores user information, OAuth client data, tokens, and other metadata. Can be MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or any other preferred database.

OAuth Client App: External applications that use OAuth flows to gain access to user data with proper authorization.
