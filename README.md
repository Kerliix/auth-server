# Authentication & OAuth Server

This project is a Node.js-based authentication server that provides user **registration**, **login**, and **OAuth 2.0 provider** functionality. It allows clients to authenticate users locally via username/password and supports OAuth authorization flows to enable third-party applications to securely access user data.

---

## Features

- **User Registration:** Create new user accounts with secure password hashing.
- **User Login:** Authenticate existing users via local credentials.
- **OAuth 2.0 Provider:** Implements OAuth 2.0 flows (Authorization Code, Implicit, etc.) to authorize third-party applications.
- **JWT / Session Support:** Issue JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or manage sessions after authentication.
- **Password Security:** Passwords are hashed securely using bcrypt.
- **Token Revocation:** Support for token invalidation and refresh tokens.
- **Role-based Access Control:** (Optional) Support for user roles and permissions.
- **Extensible & Modular:** Easily extend with custom authentication strategies or OAuth scopes.

Architecture Explanation
Client Application: This is any frontend or third-party application (web app, mobile app, or external service) that needs user authentication or wants to act as an OAuth client to access user data.

Authentication Server: The core Node.js server built with Express. It handles:

User Registration & Login: Receives and validates user credentials.

OAuth 2.0 Provider: Supports authorization flows using OAuth2orize or a custom implementation, allowing clients to request access tokens.

Token Management: Issues JWTs or session tokens for authenticated users.

Password Security: Hashes passwords securely using bcrypt before storing.

Database: Stores user information, OAuth client data, tokens, and other metadata. Can be MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or any other preferred database.

OAuth Client App: External applications that use OAuth flows to gain access to user data with proper authorization.

Technologies Used
Node.js

Express.js

Passport.js (local and OAuth strategies)

bcrypt for password hashing

jsonwebtoken for token creation and verification

OAuth2orize (or custom OAuth2 server implementation)

MongoDB / PostgreSQL / any database (your choice)

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js >= 14.x

npm or yarn

MongoDB / PostgreSQL (or other configured database)

Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auth-oauth-server.git
cd auth-oauth-server
npm install
Configuration
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following environment variables:

env
PORT=4000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/authdb
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_oauth_client_id
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_oauth_client_secret
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
Modify the configuration as per your environment and secrets.

Running the Server

npm start
The server will start on http://localhost:4000

API Endpoints
Authentication
Method	Endpoint	Description
